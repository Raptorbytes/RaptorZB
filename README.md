* Open-source it?? (Probably)
* Make it in a better and faster language like Rust or C/CPP

[![skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=python)](https://skillicons.dev)
### Purpose: 

*To learn python stuff*

### Why am I writing this README?

*Because it looks cool and makes me feel like I'm being productive*

# Build instructions:

**Run the included .py file and follow instructions. It should leave you with a <insert name you gave>.zip file and thats that.**

# DO NOT UNZIP THE FILE UNLESS YOU ARE ALRIGHT WITH THE COMPLETE CONSEQUENCES OF THE SIZE OF THE ZIP YOU CREATED!!
